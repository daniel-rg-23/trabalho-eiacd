> Game instructions
----------------------
## To run the code
### Pre-conditions
First you need to make sure you have `python` installed, after that you need to install the package `pygame` which is the responsible for the creation of the interface, therefore you would need this not only to create a game if you wanted to, but also to run a game that was constructed using this package and its libraries.

If you don't have pygame installed you can run the next command:
```
pip install pygame
```
> [!NOTE]
> In case you wanted to know more details regarding the use of pygame, click [here](https://www.pygame.org/docs/)

### In your system
</sub>***From github***

  In order to get access to the different files that make the game, click [here](https://github.com/daniel-rg-23/trabalho-eiacd)
  You can run the code by downloading each of the files.

> [!TIP]
> Make sure you insert each file inside the correspondent folder, otherwise your code may have difficulties in running

</sub>***From Visual Studio Code***

+ You can also access to the code from the `vscode app` or by entering [here](https://vscode.dev/)
+ Once you are the you can click in:
  ```

2. select between :
```
  + DFS
  + BFS
  + Iterative deepening
  + Greedy search
  + A star
  + Weighted A star
```

3. Now you can click in _Play!_ and you will find another screen that will have different levels.
4. In the game you will have ***two pieces*** that you have to get to an _objective point_. If you made a mistake and you would like to go back to your last play, or to restart the level, you can do so by click in:
