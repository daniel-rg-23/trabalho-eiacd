# Match the tiles
> Game instructions
----------------------
## To run the code
### Pre-conditions
First you need to make sure you have `python` installed, after that you need to install the package `pygame` which is the responsible for the creation of the interface, therefore you would need this not only to create a game if you wanted to, but also to run a game that was constructed using this package and its libraries.

If you don't have pygame installed you can run the next command:
```
pip install pygame
```

### In your system
> From github

including a “readme” file with instructions on how to compile, run and use the program.
